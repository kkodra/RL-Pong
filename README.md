State-space: Product of all possible locations of the ball, all possible moves of the paddle, all possible directions of the ball.
Envinronment is 14 x 20 units where one unit is the size of the ball. Pygame has been used to code the environment.

* Monte Carlo (Best results)
* Temporal difference (Q-Learning)
\* Work in Progress \*
